# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather tracking app that displays current weather and five day forcast of a city. You can search for any city in the world and your searches will be saved in the sidebar allowing you to go see the weather of any city you previously searched. The current weather also displays whether the current UV index is favorable (green), moderate (yellow), or severe (red).
